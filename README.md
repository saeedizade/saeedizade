## Hi everyone
I am Mohammad Javad Saeedizade. I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate at Linkoping University under the supervision of Eva Blomqvist. My research is at the intersection of NLP and Knowledge Graphs (form AI prospectives: Link prediction, Noise removal, etc.). If you have an interesting idea in my research interests, shoot me an email to work on it together.
